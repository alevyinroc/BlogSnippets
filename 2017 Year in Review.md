2017 turned out to be a year of transitions for me, both personal and professional. Looking back on it, I'm left in a state of wonder that it all happened.

I'm heavily involved with my son's Cub Scout Pack and in late 2016, I took on the role of Committee Chairperson. Long (very long) story short, we (Pack leadership) found ourselves in a tumultuous situation which dragged on for about 8 weeks, a lot of hurt feelings, and the near-dissolution of the Pack. I was such a wreck that at one point, I ate maybe 1 1/2 meals over the course of two days and what little sleep I was getting wasn't restful. I am eternally grateful for the many long hours both the professional and other volunteer Scouters spent helping with the situation itself and speaking with me personally, either on the phone or in person. I was ready to throw in the towel, give up, and walk away on more than one occasion. Ultimately, the Pack was saved and I believe that the unit is stronger for having gone through it. We have more parents volunteering to help, a more clear chain of succession for key leadership roles, and as I step down as Committee Chair at the end of 2017 I feel confident that my successor will do a better job than I have done.

Why am I telling you this? For two reasons. First, I've found that there are a lot of people in the SQL Server community who are or have been active in Scouting over the years and while I don't want anyone to have to go through that again, I think they'll relate. Second, at the moment things hit their worst, I was interviewing for a new job *and* I was working on a very high-profile, high-pressure project at work. I do not know how I escaped February and March 2017 with any shred of sanity left.

In February & March, I was neck-deep in a reporting project at work. My teammates & I locked ourselves away for about seven weeks working on a package of a half-dozen reports with ever-changing requirements and definitions of terms. Probably the most complex logic I've ever written purely for a report with more `PIVOT` statements in 6 weeks than I've written in my career and horrible abuses of tempdb. Never in my life have I been more confused about the definition of “last week.”

While this was going on, I interviewed for a job as a full-time DBA at a small software company in Rochester. I’d been with my employer for over a decade and leaving someplace after so long can be a difficult decision. In this case, however, it was becoming clear that my personal goals were not well-aligned with the direction of the company, so it was the right change to make and the timing was nearly perfect.

Despite the chaos I was in the middle of, the interviews went smoothly, in no small part because I already knew one of my interviewers (and my future colleague) through the SQL Server community. Networking works, folks! I got through the interviews, discussions were had, and I started my first job as an official, full-time production DBA at the end of March.
