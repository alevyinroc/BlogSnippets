## So, about that "SQLiubrium" thing...

I was going to write this last month while on vacation. That didn't happen. I spent my time relaxing, not thinking about much of anything (though I did restart a presentation outline I've struggling with for a while). It was a sorely-needed "reset" for myself and the rest of my family.

I had drafted a much longer post but when the #tsqltuesday invite went out, but it wasn't coming together well, so rather than attempt to salvage it, I'm scrapping & starting over. 

That's one thing I'm trying to change this year; I'm trying to get better at recognizing when I need to stop what I'm doing and go back to the beginning, instead of attempting to force something work that just isn't going well.

In hindsight, 2017 through the first quarter of 2018 was rough and I let a lot of things get out of hand that negatively affected me physically and mentally.

\+ I got a new job! Lots to learn, lots to explore. I became a production DBA, not a developer who plays DBA in the development environment.  
\- I got so wrapped up in my new job that I tended toward workaholism. Wouldn't step away from my desk at the end of the day - just kept working 30-60 minutes later than I should have each day. I slacked off with running. I got out of shape and gained weight. I made a lot of excuses but they were just that - excuses.  
\+ We hosted a successful SQL Saturday in March 2018. Our best attendance in a few years, and our first ever Women in Technology panel was a big success.  
\- After getting the SQL Saturday date locked in, I realized I'd scheduled it in direct conflict with my daughter's birthday. Then we scheduled my son's Crossover ceremony for moving up from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts (guess who was the MC for that) two days after SQL Saturday.  
\+ My son's Cub Scout Pack (for which I was the Committee Chair) came out of a period of significant turmoil mostly intact.  
\- Dealing with that mess probably took a couple years off my life.
